Prior to running the tests, and after rebuilding go 1.5 with go 1.4.2

Remember to change your default go to 1.5 by changing your path.

```
./myall --v --run=go_test:crypto/ecdsa -v
```

The script myall must be in the directory 

```
/miago/go/src
```

or where ever your go/src directory is located.
